For each ticket holder enter ...

THe program will record the ticket sale and calculate the ticket cost (and the profit).

Once you have either sold all of the tickets or entered the exit code ('xxx'), the program will display the ticket
sales information and write the data to a text file.

It will also choose one lucky ticket holder who wins the draw (their ticket is free).
